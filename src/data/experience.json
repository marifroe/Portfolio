    "description": "As a member of a multinational project team, I independently developed a native iOS app using Swift. Having no prior knowledge with Swift nor native app development, I quickly and independently learned how to implement authentication, connect to a RestAPI, and read iPhone sensor data. i also gained insight into the design process and was able to actively contribute. thanks to my structured way of working, i was able to meet milestones and report progress to the project manager in regular meetings.",
