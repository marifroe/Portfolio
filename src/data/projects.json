I used the prototype as context to test three different representations of guides with varying degrees of visual realism. To simplify the creation process I looked at ways of recording real tour guides to transfer their behavioral realism onto the virtual guides. For example, I explored the Quest's body and face tracking to animate a MetaHuman. Through user testing, I then compared the representations towards Social Presence and overall user acceptance.",
