    "description": "Virtual environments can be complex and overwhelming. In addition, when wearing a bulky head-mounted display one easily feels isolated from the real world. \n For my Master's thesis I investigated how humanoid embodied tour guides could be created to accompany and guide users in a Mixed Reality environment. Working with UE4 and Meta's Quest Pro, I created a Mixed Reality art gallery prototype. I used the prototype as context to test three different representations of guides with varying degrees of visual realism. To simplify the creation process I looked at ways of recording real tour guides to transfer their behavioral realism onto the virtual guides. For example, I explored the Quest's body and face tracking to animate a MetaHuman. Through user testing, I then compared the representations towards Social Presence and overall user acceptance.",
